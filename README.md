# Graph_Theory_Shortest_Path_Optimization_Engine-Dijkstra_Algorithmic_Toolkit
Comprehensive graph-optimization engine implementing Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm with adjacency-list/adjacency-matrix support, priority-queue optimization via binary heap, and O(E log V) runtime guarantees. Includes path reconstruction, weighted graph extensibility, benchmarking suite, and modular API for algorithmic integration.
